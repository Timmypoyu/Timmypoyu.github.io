# Like Life: The Role of Art Museum and Exhibition

###### Michael Jackson and Bubbles, Jeff Koons, 1988
#### The Like Life: Sculpture, Color and The Body exhibition at the Met presents many well-known sculptures, including Edgar Degas' *The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer*, Jeff Koon’s *Michael Jackson and Bubbles* and Thomas Southwood and Jacques Talrich's *'Auto-Icon' of Jeremy Bentham*. The exhibition aims to explore the fluctuating duality of life and art, especially how each can trespass the realm of the other. Ranging from the 1300’s to recent years, each sculpture conveys humans’ living experience in a different light. Some, like those of the Renaissance, idealize human figures by presenting well-proportioned and well-defined figures. Others, such as *Self*, a frozen-blood self-portrat by Marc Quinn, sought to embody the suffering, eroding aspects of organic reality. Like Life is separated into eight sections: “The Presumption of White,” “Likeness,” “Desire for Life,” “Proxy Figures,” “Layered Realities,” “Figuring Flesh,” and “Between Life and Art," all of which disregard the chronological constraint of the paintings and instead focus on the sculptures' attributes as they pertain to the elaborate thematic designed by the curators.

### **The Entrance**

#### Like Life is one of the few exhibitions that have confused me upon entrance. Contrary to instinct (or generic conditioning) to enter through the right, the exhibition directs the visitors to the left while maintaining an exiting opening on the right. The elaborate entry way at the left slightly irritated the visitors, dislodging them from their spatial and directional habits. The unintuitive placement of the entrance destabilizes the visitors sense of space, and appropriately introduces them to the section of “The Presumption of White” in which they are encouraged to walk around, and circle the sculptures, viewing the artworks dynamically with a heightened sense of spatial awareness. The same kind of layouts continued throughout the exhibition. With no distinct demarcation or guidance to direct the flow, the visitors have to make conscious decisions as to where to proceed. One can start with last or the first piece of a section in which a collection of artworks coherently represent the themes with which the curators have decided.

### **Problem in Thematic Sectioning: The Role of Museum and of Curators**

#### “The sculpture exhibition at the Met Breuer is at once scholarly and populist—the curatorial version of a TED talk.” [wrote Peter Schjeldahl, art critic from the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/like-life-shows-seven-hundred-years-of-the-body). 

#### Straddling between creating a popular exhibition endowed with popular artworks and providing, with the use of thematic sectioning, an instructional, educational experience, Like Life feels confused. While, with the layouts provided, the visitors are encouraged to move freely, the instructional themes forces the visitors to create a preconceived mindset upon viewing the artworks. “The Presumption of White” juxtaposed ancient and modern sculptures that follow the renaissance heritage of whiteness, telling a story of misconstrued artistic tradition of the classical era where sculptures are in fact painted. The curators encourage viewers to think about their social commentary on race and gender, as they presented white sculptures of a Native American and an aging, sagging old woman. Schjeldahl argues further:

> I lack both the space and the heart to paraphrase the respective analyses, which for the most part are cogent but feel really on target only for lesser works, which derive their content more from the collective bias of their times and places than from the individual character of their makers. Good art is irreducible to attitudes, and great art demolishes them.

#### There is indeed a possibility of such danger in Like Life, where these artworks become mere examples of their collective theme rather than independent works of art with their own nuances and context. 

#### However, in designing the exhibition in accordence to what Schjeldahl argued to be overly instructional themes, Like Life provides a democratizing experience in which everyone can enjoy the exhibition and peek into the minds of curators. Just as a layperson can understand TED talks, so too can s/he understand Like Life. This conversation is reminiscent of the ancient discussion on the stained glass windows of Gothic cathedrals, which could act as both conduit for the public to approach the covert and aristocratic knowledge of religion.

#### There is, however, an opposite effect.

#### While the instructional elements will exist more or less in the design of an exhibition, Schjeldahl argues that an exhibition should be more experiential than “hypercharged with sensation and glutted with instruction”. In the analogy of Gothic cathedrals, the painted windows may portray biblical stories and lessons so the illiterate people of the time could easily understand. Yet, hiding behind the democratization is the power-play of what ideas are to be depicted. Who decides?

#### Underlying Schkeldahl’s eagerness to allow the viewers of art a chance to experience art on their own terms is, perhaps, a firm base of trust and confidence in people and their own interpretations. Like Life strives to be easily understood; however, the themes curated underscore an aristocratic power of decision. They are consecrated as the over-arching subject of a collective of distinct artworks, simultaneously making them readily perceivable, and impenetrably over-generalizing and perhaps even deceiving.
