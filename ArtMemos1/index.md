#### The David Hockney exhibition at the MET took the visitors through the life of Hockney, witnessing his drastic transition in style, medium and subject. From the dark-hued, modernist abstract painting of his earlier career to the jewel-toned, verdant portrayal his backyard in Yorkshire, Hockney employed such a wide range of stylistic and narrative approaches. The visitors must undergo what seems like a secession of Hegelian epochal breakage as they step from a room of paintings encrusted with thick earthy, colors, chaotic smudges and 2-D human figures, to another filled with paintings that are covered with delicate and thin jewel-toned strokes with repeating patterns and straight lines. However, while the paintings’ style substantially changes over time, Hockney’s playfulness with disjointed perspectives, layered reality and empty spaces persisted throughout the exhibition. Homoeroticism remain permeated throughout his works as they transitioned from the central narrative moment in his earlier paintings to a strong undertone in his later ones.
