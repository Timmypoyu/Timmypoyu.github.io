The David Hockney exhibition at the MET took the visitors through the life of Hockeny, witnessing his drastic transition in style,
medium and subject. From the dark-hued, modernist abstract painting of his earlier career to the recent jewel-toned, verdant landscape of 
his backyard in Yorkshire, Hockney's coming-og-age struggle is laid before our eyes.
