#### On March 30, Kathy Griffin uploaded a photo of her holding the U.S. President Donald Trump’s bloodied, decapitated, fake head. The photo incited unanimous opposition across social media and news outlets. Her appearance on CNN’s annual New Year’s Eve broadcast was cancelled. She has since been detained multiple times at the airport (for an upper-class white woman, this is rare). She was on Interpol’s international-criminals list. Unprecedentedly, the Secret Service launched an investigation based on her controversial photo. 

For once, both left and right of the country came together in denouncing Griffin’s act: the head of the President of the United States is not to be decapitated, even in art. Yet, is it really? 

Leon Golub, a noted political artist, often uses his art as a medium to convey the reality of human condition and political oppression. Following the Vietnamese war in the 1960’s, Golub and his wife, Nancy Spero became anti-war social critics. His art, not limited to the Vietnamese War, addresses war and sociopolitical unrest at large, including the apartheid regime in South Africa, the 1976 massacre at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, and death squads of the Salvadoran civil war.
