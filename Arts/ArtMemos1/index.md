# David Hockney: Sexuality and Style
![image of painting](https://github.com/Timmypoyu/Timmypoyu.github.io/blob/master/ArtMemos1/IMG_Entry.jpg?raw=true)
###### David Hockney Exhibition in The Metropolitan Museum of Art
#### The David Hockney exhibition at the MET takes visitors through the life of Hockney, allowing them to witness his drastic transitions in style, medium and subject. From the dark-hued, modernist abstract paintings of his earlier career to the jewel-toned, verdant portrayals of his backyard in Yorkshire, Hockney employs such a wide range of stylistic and narrative approaches that visitors must undergo what seems like a secession of Hegelian epochal breakage as they step from a room of paintings encrusted with thick earthy, colors, chaotic smudges and 2-D human figures, to another filled with paintings that are covered with delicate and thin jewel-toned strokes with repetitive artificial patterns and straight lines. While the paintings’ style substantially changes over his life, Hockney’s playfulness with disjointed perspectives persists throughout. Homoeroticism permeates his work as it transitions from the central thematic moment in his earlier paintings to a strong undertone in the later ones. 

### **Homosexuality**

###### Right Side: David Hockney - *Shame* 1960 - oil on board, 50x40 in.
#### David Hockney’s earlier paintings such as *The Third Love Painting* and *Shame* are esoteric, codified with painted phrases and letters strewn across their surfaces. Phallic shapes unyieldingly occupy the canvass, breaking chaotic lines and imposing themselves over the muddied composition. Hockney drew inspiration from the urban environment around him. The gritty subculture of graffiti and anonymous writings in bathroom stalls rebelliously exclaim personal betrayal and society's failings. Hockney borrows this device to express the unbroachable topic of his sexuality, adding a shroud of impropriety to his painting. Yet, the use of phallic shapes and primary colors stand prominently as if depicting his passion bursting defiantly out of the shadows where homoeroticism had been subjugated by society’s mores. In these works, Hockney struggles to come to terms with his homosexuality. Snippets of words and phrases such as “David, just admit it.” and “SHAME” allow the viewer a sneak peek inside Hockney’s psyche, rendering the viewer a voyeur who completes the dynamics of the oppressor and the oppressed.

###### Left Side: David Hockney - *The Room, Tarzana* 1967-1977 - acrylic on canvas, 96x96 in.
###### Right Side: David Hockney - *Man In Shower in Beverly Hills* 1964 - acrylic on canvas, 65 1/2 x 65 1/2 in.
#### After moving to California, Hockney found new passion in portraying nubile men in idyllic settings filled with greenery and turquoise, iridescent swimming pools reflecting light of the Californian sun. Hockney's stylistic shift was radical. Unlike earlier works that presented ostensible internal chaos, paintings such as *The Room, Tarzana* and *Man in Shower in Beverly Hills* are over-saturated and mostly un-textured. Their lines are exactingly straight and angular. These jewel-toned paintings present a Californian bohemia, void of any worry or concern. While the young men had their backs turned towards the voyeuring viewers, the sense of intrusion of privacy is significantly lessened. Instead, the paintings and their spaciousness created by the abundance of light welcome the viewers to look at the unobstructed male nudity. The difference in Hockney's subject and technique signifies a change in Hockney’s attitude toward his own sexuality, shifting from censure and confusion to colorful celebration.

### Extra Thoughts - *Perspective*

###### David Hockney- *American Collectors (Fred & Marcia Weisman)* 1968 - acrylic on canvas, 84x120 in. 
#### In the example above, Hockney intentionally cuts short the background, challenging the viewer's expectation of "natural" or "correct" perspective. By disrupting the viewer's search of the vanishing point, the painting seems off-balanced and incomplete, enhancing the its unsettled tone, in which nothing in frame is comfortable, resolved, or secure-in-place. In the second image, I mapped out (with yellow lines) what appears to be Hockney's use of linear perspective with a single vanishing point at the top left. However, instead of filling in the background, consummating the rule of linear perspective, Hockney decided to leave it blank.
