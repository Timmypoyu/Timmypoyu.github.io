# Protest Art: Kathy Griffin and Leon Golub

#### On March 30, Kathy Griffin uploaded a photo of her holding the U.S. President Donald Trump’s bloodied, decapitated, fake head. The photo incited unanimous opposition across social media and news outlets. Her appearance on CNN’s annual New Year’s Eve broadcast was cancelled. She has since been detained multiple times at the airport. She was on Interpol’s international-criminals list. Unprecedentedly, the Secret Service launched an investigation based on her controversial photo. 

#### For once, both left and right of the country came together in denouncing Griffin’s act: the head of the President of the United States is not to be decapitated, even in art. Yet, is it really?

#### Leon Golub, a noted political artist, often uses his art as a medium to convey the reality of human condition and political oppression. Following the Vietnamese war in the 1960’s, Golub and his wife, Nancy Spero became anti-war social critics. His art, not limited to the Vietnamese War, [addresses war and sociopolitical unrest at large](https://www.forbes.com/sites/claytonpress/2018/02/25/leon-golub-raw-nerve-at-the-met-breuer-new-york/#6fe47e3e2f55), including the apartheid regime in South Africa, the 1976 massacre at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, and death squads of the Salvadoran civil war.

#### His paintings often depict tattered, exposed and deformed human bodies amidst of conflicts or war zones, conveying an extremely visceral sense of violence. Golub’s process of creating these powerful works is equally brutal: he would apply multiple layers of gesso and paints and then carve them away with a meat cleaver. This technique is extremely destructive, unrelenting, and taxing, asking the artist to enact violence during the creative process, just as the finished product evokes in the viewer a raw and unnerving response. 

#### In his artistic approach, Golub tries to make viewers uncomfortable and their viewing experience unendurable. He further elaborates: 
> To make painting unendurable is not to demonstrate solidarity with the tortured, a smug and self-deceptive alliance. To make it 
> unendurable is to recognize that we are all occupied with making (social, political, cultural) systems work.

#### For Golub, Art is meant to destabilize. Granted, unlike Golub’s thought-out and sophisticated approach, Griffin’s photo largely caters to gaudy sensationalism to intends to create an overtly shocking effect. However, Griffin has successfully destabilized the viewing public, making its viewing experience unendurable. In a year when all mainstream comedy revolved around Trump, Griffin finally crossed the line, making her comedy dangerous to those who expect to have an easy, vacuous laugh.  

#### Unfortunately, Griffin was not ready to receive the public outcry against her. She decried the fact that she is being socially and politically persecuted. If she aimed, as Golub did, to make art unendurable to view, the social opposition, the refractory effect of her having agitated her viewers against herself, would only suggest that she has succeeded.
