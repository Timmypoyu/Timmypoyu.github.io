# Abramovic and Arendt: On the Body

#### Marina Abramovic is one of the most influential performance artists in the twentieth century. Her performances often challenge and incite discussion on the power, the potential, the limits of the human body and mind, and their relation with the world we live in. In her performance, [rhythm 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTBkbseXfOQ), in 1974, she displayed 74 various objects on a table in a gallery, and invited the audience to use these objects to do whatever they wish to her body for six hours. These objects included, among other things, a feather, perfume, olive oil, rose, scissors, a metal bar, a scalpel, a gun, and a bullet. She described the process: 
> They became more and more wild, they cut my neck and drank my blood...then one person took the pistol, put the bullet in and tried see if I would really with my own hand pull the trigger…the gallery came and completely went crazy, taking the gun out of his hands and throwing it out the window…

#### She further elaborates:
>The gallery came and said that the performance is over. I started moving and started being myself… and at that moment, everybody ran away. People could not actually confront with me as a person.

#### In her performance of rhythm 0, Abramovic experienced a complete subjugation of agency and objectification of her body. The visiting crowd treated her as an object of manipulation, as an alien to whom a loaded gun could be held at her neck. In Hannah Arendt's term, she had been reduced to a situation shared with that of a “stateless” person.

#### In the Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt discussed the profusion of stateless people in post-war Europe. Due to political circumstances beyond the control and will of an individual, the European societies has displaced large numbers of refugees, who existed in the confused, ambiguous space between repatriation and assimilation, between naturalization and liquidation. Existing outside the legal framework of a nation-state, these stateless people did not enjoy the civil rights and human rights granted by the nation-state. They were stripped of all their communal connections and social qualities, reduced to nothing except for a human, a raw, bare boned human in each of their own unique individuality. They are brutalized, subjected to to the fickle charity and violence of the state police, thus indirectly giving way to the totalitarianism witnessed in WWII. Arendt lamented: 
> The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.

#### In the face of these liquidated, stateless refugees, the state does not know what to do. Arendt proposed that these stateless people are exterior to human rights. The existence of the stateless refugees and the violent response against them forced a rude realization that perhaps being human does not equate respectability, that there is nothing inalienable and natural about human rights.

#### Rhythm 0 experimented with a similar idea: how would the crowd react if presented with a person void of agency? Abramovic was stripped naked, cut on her throat, and almost shot. The audience grew into a riotous mob, perhaps shedding themselves of all ethical and moral bearings. In that isolated gallery, Abramovic could have been killed. Just as the stateless people were subjected to the arbitrary mercy or violence of the state police, Abramovic’s survival was largely due to chance, not because she was human and inherently deserved to live.

#### Even with such a carefully orchestrated performance, Abramovic could not have truly experienced what happened in the lives of the stateless people. Despite this, both experiences demonstrated the same haunting reality that the basic human body is nothing innately special as it can so easily be reduced to what it truly is: mere flesh. Rhythm 0 revealed that a simple gallery engagement with a person of suspended agency could allow the civilized collective to spiral into savagery and violence. As Abramovic started to move, she ceased to be an alien and became her own person, causing the crowd to scurry away, shocked at how quickly they had descended, how estranged they had become.
