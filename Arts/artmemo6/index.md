#### The film Call Me by Your Name has found its way into my heart. Masterfully executed, it strikes a delicate balance in creating tension by prolonging the consummation of the love between the two lovers, Art History PhD student Oliver and professor’s son Elio, and relieving the tension point for the viewers as Oliver and Elio slowly approach each other as the film progresses. The setting, Crema, Italy, provided the perfectly idyllic and painteresque landscape, enveloping and cushioning the characters from reality. The film was saturated with nudities of nubile young men and women uninhibited from their expression of lust and desire, creating a movie brimming of ethos. Oliver and Elio were transported into an edenic space where every element is consummately designed to lead to the germination of their romantic relationship. I want to take time in this memo to draw a comparison with the depictions of nature in both the film and impressionist paintings, and how they use the theme of nature to evoke a particular sense of ethos and mood.

#### In the beginning of the industrial revolution, the concepts of leisure and labor became increasingly separate. As the productivity of the machine replaced human labor, people had extra time for time for entertainment. On top of that, the grubby condition of the factories and industrial cities encouraged city dwellers to abscond the hustle of the city and instead search for life in the countryside reminiscent of what had been. The appreciation and interest for fauna and flora grew significantly under the thriving locomotion of technology and economy in the modern era. 

#### Many impressionist painters sought to capture nature in their paintings. Characterized by the principle of portraying the scenery as seen by their eyes, painters such as Monet or Manet were able to record natural landscape in its temporal, chameleonic shapes and colors. Even though the impressionist portrayals may not be a poignant commentary on the industrial revolution, they serve as conduits from modernity into agrarian nostalgia, from structure to de-structure.

#### The setting of CMBYN resonates profoundly with the naturalistic scenes portrayed in the impressionist paintings. In several moments of the film, Oliver and Elio lay on a lush meadow, heads resting ever so slightly against each other with the camera reeling softly in bird-eyed angles. They dipped half nakedly into the river with the water surface rippling and reflecting silver streaks of sunlight. The cinematography harkens to the colors of David Hockney’s jewel-toned paintings of Californian suburbs. The scenes were beautiful, yet just like the ephemerality intrinsic to impressionist paintings, they were fleeting. Opposed to having the movie shot in a metropolitan setting, CMBYN's elaborately chosen countryside allowed human emotions to unfold, inflate and fill up the space. I believe such an artistic decision revealed humans' yearning to return to nature just as impressionist artwork did, for it seems to suggest that it is in nature that the human ethos can be unbound and celebrated.

#### Despite having the purest of longing and love between them, however, Oliver and Elio’s story, at last, came to the rude realization that Crema’s summer would end, and that reality would kick in. In fact, the title of the movie foreshadows the gut-wrenching, Aristophanic climax. In a scene in which the two characters lay intimately in bed with limbs intertwined, Oliver, with an exceedingly humble and vulnerable voice, pleaded Elio to call him by Elio's name. “Call me by your name and I will call you by mine.” What followed was a transcendental moment with both characters taking turns calling each other compulsively by their own name. The scene communicates the burning intensity with which the two lovers love each other, so much so that they want to be each other. There seems to exist an eternal sorrow and emptiness in harboring love so strong and immaculate. For Oliver and Elio, life together is beautiful yet excruciating. It would never be enough as long as they remain two separate entities. The yearning to become one through love was not only physical but spiritual and consuming. 

#### At the very end, Oliver boarded the train, leaving behind love, nature, and Elio.
