#### The presidential portraits for Obamas denoted a remarkable break from the traditions set by prior presidents. While many critics has condemned the presidential portraits as overly sensational, unrealistic and ungrounded, these portraits’ distinct disruption of precedence has duly corresponded to the characteristic and land-marking presidency of Barack Obama. In this journal, I will mainly focus on the former president’s portraits as I believe that it has a clearer historical line to trace back, and that the presidency holds more political bearings and importance.

### **Controversial Commision**

#### President Obama’s choice of artist for his portrait, Kehinde Wiley, was particularly controversial. Wiley is known for placing black bodies in western themed trope, such as his series that incorporates mixed race figures in the similar composition as the classical paintings of Titian, Van Dyck, Ingres and David. His paintings also include “tattooed figures from the streets of New York, stars of pop culture and portraits from the African continent”, thus making colored figures his subjects, empowering them, and subverting European hegemony in western art. His painting often evokes gory, shocking images, such as his rendition of the Judith holding the bloodied head of Holofernes that is depicted as a black woman holding the severed cranium of a white woman.

#### As Obama stepped down from his presidency, he gained greater freedom in expressing his opinion regarding the racial issues in America. Choosing Wiley, President Obama has shown a firm alliance of never-before-seen intensity with the African American community. In fact, I would argue that President Obama’s commission of Wiley would not have been a political savvy decision if he was still incumbent. It was with the newly-found apolitical status as an ex-president and in response to the increasingly confused racial landscape under Trump’s presidency that this commission is made timely and appropriate. Considering President Obama’s position in the line of presidents in the US, he was quite literally a mixed-race figure inserted in a historically white-exclusive role, striking a whimsical correlation with Wiley’s common theme within his artistic oeuvre. 

### **Closer Look**

#### The presidential portraits elaborately broke away from the tradition. President Obama, instead of standing upright at the bottom of the staircase as did President Teddy Roosevelt or sitting rather aplomb in an office setting, sit in an ornate wooden chair against a wall teeming of bright green vines. Unlike the traditional evocation of the office of presidency, Wiley turned the focus towards President Obama’s background, his heritage, and his life story. Out of the shrubbery, pokes out a few flowers – “chrysanthemums, official flower of Chicago, jasmine from Obama’s birth state of Hawaii, and blue lilies representing his African heritage”, all of which illuminate president Obama’s various identities, consolidating him as a president whose charisma was largely informed by his background. Yet, the painting is not wholly consisted of appraisal. At times, the flowers vied for the attention of the viewer in the expense of creating diversion from the president. The president looks significantly older and scrawnier than real life, with prominent silver streaks in his hair. Wiley acknowledges the doubled effect Obama’s background has affected his presidency: it burdens, complicates, popularizes him all at once.
