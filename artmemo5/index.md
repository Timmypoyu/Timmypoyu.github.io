# Abramovic and Arendt: On the Body 
![image](https://github.com/Timmypoyu/Timmypoyu.github.io/blob/master/artmemo4/obama1.jpeg?raw=true)
#### Marina Abramovic is one of the most influential performance artist in the twentieth century. Her performances often times challenge and incite discussion on the power, the potential, the limits of the human body and mind, and their relations with the world we live in. In her performance, rhythm 0, in 1974, she displayed 74 various objects on a table in a gallery, and invites the viewer to use these objects to do whatever they wish to her body for six hours. These objects include a feather, perfume, olive oil, rose, scissors, a metal bar, a scalpel, a gun and a bullet. She described the process: 
> They became more and more wild, they cut my neck and drink my blood.. the one person took the pistol, put the bullet and  see if I would really with my own hand push the target…the gallery came and completely go crazy, take this gun out of his hands and throw it out of the window…

#### She further elaborates:
>The gallery came and said that the performance is over. I started moving and start being myself… and at that moment, everybody ran away. People could not actually confront with me as a person. 

#### In her performance of rhythm 0, abramovic experienced a complete subjugation of agency and objectification of her body. The visiting crowd treated her as an object of manipulation, as an alien with which a loaded gun could be held at her neck. In Hannah Arendt term, she has been reduced to a situation shared with that of a “stateless” person.

#### In the Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt discussed the profusion of stateless people in post-war Europe. Due to political circumstances beyond the control and will of an individual, the European societies has displaced large numbers of refuges, who exists in the confused, ambiguous space between repatriation and assimilation, between naturalization and liquidation. Existing outside the legal framework of a nation-state, these stateless people does not enjoy the civil rights and human rights granted by the nation-state. They are stripped of all their communal connections and social qualities, reduced to nothing except for a human, a raw, bare boned human in each of their own unique individuality. They are brutalized, subjected to to the fickle charity and violence of the state police, thus indirectly giving way to totalitarianism witnessed in the WWII. In the face of these stateless refugees, the state does not know what to do. Arendt lamented: 
> The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.

#### In the face of these liquidated, stateless refugees, the state does not know what to do. Arendt proposed that these stateless people are exterior to human rights. The existence of the stateless refugees and the violent response against them forced a rude realization that perhaps being human does not equate respectability, that there is nothing inalienable and natural about human rights.

#### Rhythm 0 experimented a similar idea: How would the crowd react if presented with a person void of agency? Abramovic was stripped naked, cut close to her throat and almost shot. The viewing crowd grew into a riotous mob, perhaps shedding themselves of the ethical and moral bearings. In that isolated gallery, Abramovic could have been killed. Just as the stateless people wre in the arbitrary mercy or violence of the state police, Abramovic’s survival was largely her luck, not because she was human and that inherently she deserved to live.

#### Even though with a carefully orchestrated performance, Abramovic could not have truly experienced what underwent in the lives of the stateless people, both experiences provided the same haunting reality that the basic human body is nothing immanently special as it can so easily be reduced to what it truly is, mere flesh. Rhythm 0 revealed that a simple gallery engagement with a person of suspended could allow the civilized collective to spiral into savagery, and violence. As Abramovic started to move, ceased to be an alien and become her own person, the crowd scurried away, shocked at how quickly they have descended, how estranged they have become.
