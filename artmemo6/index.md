#### The film Call Me by Your Name has found its way into my heart. Masterfully executed, it strikes a delicate balance in creating tension by prolonging the consummation of the love between the two lovers, the PHD student Oliver who studies Art history and the professor’s son, Elio and relieving the tension point for the viewers, as Oliver and Elio slowly approach each other as the film progresses. The setting, Crema, Italy, provided the perfectly idyllic and painteresque landscape, enveloping and cushioning the characters from reality. The film was saturated with nudities of nubile man and young women uninhibited from their expression of lust and desire, creating a movie brimming of ethos. Oliver and Elios were transported into an edenic space where every element is coherently designed to lead to the germination of their romantic relationship. I want to take time in this memo to draw comparison with the depiction in both the film and impressionist paintings, and how they use the theme of nature to evoke a particular sense of ethos, and mood.

#### In the beginning of the industrial revolution, the conception of leisure and labor became increasingly separate. As the productivity of the machine replaced human labor, people have extra time for time for entertainment. On top of that, the grubby condition of the factories and industrializing cities encouraged city dwellers to abscond the hustle of the city, in search for life in the countryside reminiscent of what had been. The appreciation and interest for faunas and floras grew significantly, under the thriving locomotion of technology and economy in the modern era. 

#### Many impressionist painters sought out to capture nature in their paintings. Characterized by the principle to naively portrayed the scenery as seen by their eyes, painters such as Monet or Manet …. was able to record natural landscape in its temporal, chameleon shapes and colors. Even though the impressionist portrayals may not be a poignant commentary on the industrial revolution, they serve as conduits from modernity into agrarian nostalgia, from structure to de-structure.

#### The settings of CMBYN resonate profoundly with the naturalistic scenes portrayed in the impressionist paintings. In several moments of the film, Oliver and Elio laid on a lush meadow, heads budding ever so slightly against each other with the camera reeling softly in bird-eyed angle. They dipped half nakedly into the river with the water surface rippling. reflecting silver streaks of sunlight. The cinematography harkens to the colors of David Hockney’s jewel-toned painting of Californian suburbs. The scenes are beautiful, yet just as the ephemerality intrinsic in impressionist paintings, it was fleeting. Oppose to having the movie shot in a metropolitan setting, CMBYN elaborately chosen a countryside to allow human emotions to unfold, inflate and fill up the space. I believe such an artistic decision revealed much of human’s yearning to return to nature as impressionist arts did, for it seems to suggest that it is in nature that the human ethos can be unbound and celebrated.

#### Yet, despite having the purest of longing and love between them, Oliver and Elio’s story, at last, come to the rude realization that Crema’s summer would end, and the reality would kick it. In fact, the title of the movie foreshadows the gut-wrenching, Aristophanic climax. In a scene, where the two characters lies intimately on a bed, limbs intertwined, Oliver, with the outmost humble and vulnerable voice, pleaded Elio to call him by Elios’ name. “Call me by your name and I will call you by mine.” What follows was a transcendental moment, where both characters take turns, calling each other compulsively by their own name. The scene communicates the burning intensity with which the two lovers love each other, so much so that they want to be each other. There seems to exist an eternal sorrow and emptiness in harboring love so strong and immaculate. For Oliver and Elios, life together is beautiful yet excruciating. It would never be enough as long as they remain two separate entities. The yearning to become one through love, was not only physical but spiritual and consuming. 

#### At the very end, Oliver boarded the train, leaving behind love, nature and Elio.
