# Marcel Duchamp: On Subversion of Art and Social Norm

#### As one of the pioneers of the Dada movement (though he distanced himself from organized art movements), Duchamp created art that challenges and destabilizes what can be accepted as a work of art. Starting out as a painter, Duchamp gradually lost interest in representational art, or in his words, “retinal pleasure,” and, consequently, he turned toward conceptual art intended to provoke ideas and thoughts. 

#### In rejecting traditional artistic principles and methods, Duchamp sought to use mass-produced objects as the medium of his works. One of his most famous artworks is “Fountain,” which is simply a urinal that Duchamp removed from its utilitarian and commercial context. With his readymade art, Duchamp reinvented the way the art viewers and critics interacted with artwork. His work relieves the viewer’s eyes from their dominant engagement with paintings or sculpture, instead creating art that is largely cerebral and conceptual. Developed as a prank on Duchamp’s partners in the Society of Independent Artists to gauge their openness to art (contrary to the common sentiments in France), “Fountain” was rejected by the Society as indecent and immoral and it being, “by no definition, a work of art.” Many critics supportive of Duchamp, however, believe that Duchamp’s artistic process in creating “Fountain” from a readymade object consolidates “Fountain” as a piece of art. Art doesn’t necessary have to be beautiful. In the same vein as the artistic merits of Jackson Pollock, the artistry lies in the process of its creation. That arts can be expressive rather than illustrative. 

#### Following the subversive characteristics that permeate throughout his work, Duchamp did not only challenge the norms within the art world but also the entire socio-political sphere (not that they don’t intertwine). His works instigate discussion on people’s preconceptions of social order and threaten to contest what the socio-political context suggests is the “absolute.” His work “Three Standard Stoppages” is a prime example. In it, Duchamp placed a canvas flat on the ground and dropped three one-meter cotton threads individually from a height of one meter. Letting them fall naturally onto the canvas, he then cut out the silhouettes of the three cotton lines on three wooden slats to represent the uncertainty and indeterminacy of socially constructed norms in the form of standard measurement. The three different and distinct silhouettes traced out according to the free-falling cotton lines indicate three of the infinite possibilities of what a meter could look like. 

#### I find Duchamp’s rationale behind the art piece even better elucidated by a Youtube video titled: “When the egg meets sperm.” The video depicts a human egg surrounded by thousands and thousands of rigorous sperms attempting to inseminate the egg. Such natural phenomena make one wonder about one’s existence brought about through sheer biological chance. 

#### With a greater scale, Duchamp applied the conception of chance to social structures and norms. The title of “Three Standard Stoppages” provides many clues into his challenge of accepted social structure. In French, “stoppage” is translated as “invisible mending” that is carried out in a sewing shop. Duchamp is perhaps suggesting that these existing socio-political norms are invisible and taken for granted. Similar to the post-structuralist and constructionist idea of Michel Foucault as presented in “Discipline and Punishment,” Duchamp highlights the permeation of these dominative socio-political norms and questions the existing power structure that relishes its comfortable absolutism. 

#### The art of Duchamp engages viewers in a new way. The viewers and their thoughts become a part of the artistic process. They are moved, destabilized, and sometimes even threatened as art can, as Duchamp might say, obligate a person to become.
